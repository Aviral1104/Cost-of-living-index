# Cost-of-living-index

This approach combines dimensionality reduction through PCA with linear regression to create a predictive model for the Cost of Living Index. By using PCA, the model can capture the most important aspects of the economic indicators while potentially reducing noise and overfitting.

## Model Performance:

  - R-squared Score of 0.97, indicating that the model explains about 97% of the variance in the Cost of Living Index.
  - Mean Squared Error of 9.10

## PCA Components:

The model used 3 PCA components, which captured 95% of the variance in your original features.

Explained Variance Ratio shows how much variance each component explains:

  - Component 1: 80.20%
  - Component 2: 9.43%
  - Component 3: 6.35%
